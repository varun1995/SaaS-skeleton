## 📌 Overview

This project is a comprehensive initiative to build a modern, full-stack Software as a Service (SaaS) application from the ground up. The application integrates user authentication, subscription management, and responsive UI design, providing a robust foundation for scalable SaaS products.

## 🧑‍💻 My Role

As the sole developer, I undertook the end-to-end development of this project, encompassing:

- **Backend Development**: Utilized Django 5 to create a secure and scalable backend, implementing user authentication with Django AllAuth and managing environment variables using Python Decouple.
- **Frontend Integration**: Designed responsive user interfaces with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated Stripe API for handling subscription payments, including setting up webhooks and managing customer billing information.
- **Database Management**: Configured Neon PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, leveraging its branching feature for safe testing environments.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized the application using a custom Dockerfile, facilitating consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment workflows, enhancing development efficiency and code reliability.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the application on Railway, streamlining the hosting process and enabling continuous integration and delivery.
